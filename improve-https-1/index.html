      Improving HTTPS on private networks

    <h3>
      Background
    </h3>

    <p>
    For the last couple months I've been fanatic about understanding why HTTPS adoption on private networks is so poor, and so poorly implemented.
    I believe the challenge comes down to poor usability of the ACME certificate issuance protocols in the context of private networks, small but meaningful cost pressures, and legacy momentum.
    I'm excited to share a service that I believe can address these shortcomings and improve network security while decreasing toil.

    <p>
    In this post I share the launch of 
    <a href="https://www.getlocalcert.net">getlocalcert.net</a>.
    Learn how the service can help you issue HTTPS certificates that are suitable for use on localhost, private networks, and internal networks.
    I walk through account registration, installation, and configuration of the Caddy web server for automated certificate issuance.

    <h3>
    Let's encrypt your private networks
    </h3>

    <p>
    With a nod to the popular Let's Encrypt project, which helped the public Internet transition from 
    <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">25% to 80% of web pages using HTTPS</a> over the last ten years,
    the goal of getlocalcert.net is to increase adoption of HTTPS on private networks through better tooling, improved documentation, a free subdomain name registrar, and a free DNS service.
    Our model uses globally trusted HTTPS certificates from certificate authorities (CAs) that support the ACME DNS-01 protocol, such as the free domain validated (DV) certificates of
    <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>
    and
    <a href="https://zerossl.com?fpr=getlocalcert&fp_sid=blg1">ZeroSSL</a><a title="Affiliate Link - we may get a commision if you purchase ZeroSSL products"><sup>1</sup></a>.
    These HTTPS certificates are preferred over self-signed certificates and private CAs as they require the least amount of configuration management on end-user devices.

    <p>
    While I rarely encounter HTTP-only websites on the Internet these days, they are still quite common on private networks.
    When HTTPS is used, it's often via private CAs.
    A private CA requires complex roll-out of the root certificate into every device on the network.
    If misused, the root certificate could enable a
    <a href="https://alexsci.com/blog/name-non-constraint/">man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack</a>
    against every website on the Internet.
    Further, managing certificate renewals can be a complicated manual process, resulting in unneeded toil, expired certificates, and broken websites.

    <p>
    Web browsers are pushing HTTPS adoption forward by disabling or limiting features like
    <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins/">service workers, CORS, geolocation, device orientation, notifications, and caching</a>
    on insecure webpages.
    Performance improvements in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2#Encryption">HTTP/2</a>,
    and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3">HTTP/3</a>
    have drastically improved performance, but only support encrypted connections.
    Websites run on private networks may benefit from these modern features, so a proper HTTPS deployment is valuable.

    <h3>
    Current status
    </h3>

    <p>
    getlocalcert is now available for early access and a subset of the planned roadmap has been implemented.
    As of today, getlocalcert supports:

    <ul>
      <li>Free subdomain registration under <span class="code">.localhostcert.net</span>
      </li>
      <li>Issuance of free, globally valid HTTPS certificates via ACME DNS-01
      </li>
      <li>Wildcard certificates are supported
      </li>
      <li>Public DNS <a href="https://docs.getlocalcert.net/records/">A records locked to <span class="code">127.0.0.1</span></a>
      </li>
      <li>Certificate automation using 
        <a href="https://docs.getlocalcert.net/acme-clients/">several popular ACME clients</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Already, this limited feature set offers a number of advantages.

    <ul>
      <li>Public CAs can issue HTTPS certificates to subdomains of
        <span class="code">.localhostcert.net</span>;
        unlike
        <span class="code">localhost</span>, <span class="code">.local</span>, or <span class="code">.corp</span> which require a private CA
      </li>
      <li>Zero client configuration: web browsers already trust certificates issued by Let's Encrypt and ZeroSSL
      </li>
      <li>Free subdomain registration supports cost sensitive use cases
      </li>
      <li>Certificate <a href="https://docs.getlocalcert.net/security/#caa-records-for-delegated-domains">misissuance can be monitored</a> (private CAs aren't subject to certificate transparency rules)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
    Setting up a demo site
    </h3>

    <p>
    I configured a simple HTTPS website that used the
    <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy web server</a>,
    a free <span class="code">.localhostcert.net</span> subdomain from getlocalcert, and a free Let's Encrypt HTTPS certificate.
    If you're already familiar with Linux system administration tasks then this process should take about five to ten minutes to replicate.

    <h4>
    Registration
    </h4>

    <p>
    First I opened
    <a href="https://console.getlocalcert.net/?utm=blog-launch-post">console.getlocalcert.net</a>
    to register an account.
    I needed to sign in with my GitHub account, but we'll eventually support email/password as well.

    <p>
    <img src="10-sign-in.png" alt="sign-in page">

    <p>
    I logged in and I clicked the 
    <span class="code">Create free domain</span> button.
    The service assigned me a globally unique subdomain name (2.localhostcert.net).

    <p>
    Here's my domain details page, showing that several
    <a href="https://docs.getlocalcert.net/records/">default DNS records</a>
    were present and were locked.
    These locked records keep getlocalcert focused on our niche: private networks.

    <p>
    <img src="30-list-records.png" alt="default DNS records">

    <p>
    At the bottom of the page I saw the section for API keys, although none existed yet.
    I created one by clicking
    <span class="code">Create new API key</span>.

    <p>
    <img src="40-list-api-keys.png" alt="API key listing">

    <p>
    The next page shows the API key.
    You'll want to save yours in a password manager, credential vault, or similar secure storage.
    Don't commit these to a git repository.
    If you accidentally expose your API key you can delete it from the listing on the previous page.
    I deleted mine before publishing this blog post.

    <p>
    <img src="50-show-new-api-key.png" alt="New API key details">

    <p>
    I used these credentials for the rest of the setup.
    If you're following along, you should substitute your own values anywhere you see these.

    <p>
    <pre><code class="language-plaintext">Domain        2.localhostcert.net
Key ID        e3b4f232-f07c-4b43-9ebe-f22a041cbcf0
Secret Key    af17de82a929fc8b95ea93943acd6917fbd3ac32b20d77476774d037171ca3f5</code></pre>


    <h4>
    Caddy Server
    </h4>

    <p>
    Next I set up Caddy.
    
    <p>
    Caddy supports getlocalcert using the
    <a href="https://github.com/caddy-dns/acmedns">ACME-DNS module</a>,
    which isn't in the default build.
    There's currently
    <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/5301">an issue</a>
    impacting Caddy builds, so I needed to build Caddy using a non-standard approach.

    <p>
    <pre><code class="language-shell">$ go install github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/cmd/xcaddy@latest
$ xcaddy build --with github.com/caddy-dns/acmedns --with github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2=github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2@v2.6.4</code></pre>

    <p>
    I created a minimal Caddy file:

    <p>
    <pre><code>2.localhostcert.net {
	tls {
		ca https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
		resolvers ns1.getlocalcert.net:53
		dns acmedns credentials.json
	}
	respond "I'm secure!"
}</code></pre>

    <p>
    Notice that I used the Let's Encrypt staging environment.
    I didn't want to use Let's Encrypt production yet as it has strict rate limits, best practice is to confirm everything is working in staging first.

    <p>
    I saved my getlocalcert credentials to a JSON file.
    Many ACME clients support a credentials file of this format.

    <p>
    <pre><code>{
  "username": "e3b4f232-f07c-4b43-9ebe-f22a041cbcf0",
  "password": "af17de82a929fc8b95ea93943acd6917fbd3ac32b20d77476774d037171ca3f5",
  "fulldomain": "2.localhostcert.net",
  "subdomain": "2",
  "server_url": "https://api.getlocalcert.net/api/v1/acme-dns-compat",
  "allowfrom": []
}</code></pre>

    <p>
    All set, I started Caddy and watched the certificate issuance process in the log output:

    <p>
    Once I saw <span class="code">certificate obtained successfully</span> I knew I had passed the ACME DNS-01 challenge.
    I checked my work by loading 2.localhostcert.net in Firefox.
    The 
    <span class="code">SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER</span>,
    error message I got here was expected as Firefox doesn't trust the Let's Encrypt staging environment.

    <p>
    If you see an issue at this step, spend some time debugging here before proceeding, or
    <a href="https://docs.getlocalcert.net/contact/">ask for help</a>.

    <p>
    <img src="60-caddy-staging-loaded.png" alt="certificate warning message for 2.localhostcert.net">

    <p>
    Finally, I commented out (#) the <span class="code">ca https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory</span> line in my Caddyfile and ran Caddy again.
    This time a certificate was issued by Let's Encrypt production.

    <p>
    The certificate was issued and I reloaded 2.localhostcert.net in Firefox.
    Now that Caddy was using a Let's Encrypt production certificate, I no longer saw the certificate warning message.
    My web page is pretty boring, but it's loading over a secure HTTP/2 connection.

    <p>
    <img src="70-caddy-production-loaded.png" alt="the web page showing valid HTTPS">

    <p>
    If you follow these steps you'll find that Caddy manages HTTPS certificate renewals automatically, so there's minimal manual maintenance toil.

    <h4>
    Next Steps
    </h4>

    <p>
    In just a couple minutes I've registered a free subdomain, configured a web server, and issued a free HTTPS certificate that my web browser immediately trusted.
    But this was just a quick demo, so there's some additional things you'll want to try next.
    You'll probably want to configure Caddy to do something useful, so head to the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/">Caddy docs</a> to learn more.

    <h5>
    Other software
    </h5>

    <p>
    Check out <a href="https://docs.getlocalcert.net/acme-clients/">the docs</a> to learn about several additional supported tools.
    Prefer to use acme.sh with NGINX?
    That's compatible with getlocalcert too!

    <h5>
    Wildcard DNS
    </h5>

    <p>
    If you'd like to host multiple subdomains, you'll currently need to use a wildcard certificate.
    Support for proper subdomains management is on the roadmap, but for now you can ask Caddy to request a wildcard certificate using:

    <pre><code>*.2.localhostcert.net, 2.localhostcert.net {
	tls {
		dns acmedns credentials.json
	}
}</code></pre>

    <p>
    A great reference for this setup is <a href="https://reinhardt.dev/posts/caddy-server-wildcards/">here</a>.

    <p>
    If you'd like to access your web server from a different computer on the same network, you can do this by changing your local DNS settings.
    An easy approach is to edit your <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/">hosts file</a>.
    You'll add an entry like:

    <p>
    <pre><code>192.168.1.105 2.localhostcert.net</code></pre>

    <p>
    Or if you've setup a wildcard certificate:

    <p>
    <pre><code>192.168.1.21 radarr.2.localhostcert.net
192.168.1.22 heimdall.2.localhostcert.net
192.168.1.23 vaultwarden.2.localhostcert.net</code></pre>

    <p>
    Alternatively, if you run a DNS server like Unbound you can manage your DNS resolution on that server.
    A simple Unbound view to remap <span class="code">2.localhostcert.net</span> to <span class="code">192.168.1.105</span> looks like:

    <p>
    <pre><code class="language-plaintext">access-control-view: 192.168.0.0/16 "localhostcert"
view:
  name: "localhostcert"
  view-first: yes
  local-zone: "2.localhostcert.net" redirect
  local-data: "2.localhostcert.net IN A 192.168.1.105"</code></pre>

    <p>
    These work best with static IP addressing.
    Read on in <a href="https://docs.getlocalcert.net/dns/">the DNS docs</a> for more help.

    <h3>
    Roadmap
    </h3>

    <p>
    There's a lot of improvements planned:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Managed A records other than just 127.0.0.1
      </li>
      <li>Deep subdomain support
      </li>
      <li>Vanity/custom subdomain names
      </li>
      <li>Bring your own domain name
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://docs.getlocalcert.net/security/#public-suffix-list">Public suffix list</a> and <a href="https://docs.getlocalcert.net/faq/#why-am-i-getting-rate-limited-by-lets-encrypt">rate limits</a>
      </li>
      <li>Documentation of all compatible ACME clients
      </li>
      <li>Privacy mitigations to counter hostnames leaked in certificate transparency logs
      </li>
      <li>Documentation for additional use cases
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    I'd love to hear your thoughts as well.

    <h3>
    Security brief
    </h3>

    <p>
    Check out the discussion of the getlocalcert security model and roadmap in
    <a href="https://docs.getlocalcert.net/security/">the docs</a>.
    None of what we've discussed so far is valuable if it doesn't provide suitable security, and as such, security remains a primary focus of the project.
    More details will be provided as we grow.

    <h3>
    Conclusion
    </h3>

    <p>
    Please <a href="https://console.getlocalcert.net/?utm=blog-launch-post">give us a try</a>.
    I hope you'll find that getlocalcert can simplify HTTPS certificate management for private networks.
